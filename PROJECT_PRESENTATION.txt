                    FIREGUARD PROJECT PRESENTATION
            Fire Safety & Evacuation Alert System - Complete Overview
================================================================================

PROJECT NAME: FireGuard
VERSION: 3.1 (Production Ready)
ORGANIZATION: The GDevelopers
REPOSITORY: https://github.com/ShivAyushNITGoa/FireGuard

================================================================================
                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

FireGuard is a modern, real-time fire safety monitoring system that detects 
dangerous conditions and sends instant alerts to users. It combines hardware 
sensors, cloud technology, and smart notifications to protect buildings and 
save lives.

Think of it as a "smart fire alarm" that not only detects fire but also tells 
you exactly where it is and what to do about it.

================================================================================
                            THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE
================================================================================

Traditional fire alarms have limitations:
  • They only make noise - you might not hear them
  • They don't tell you WHERE the fire is
  • They don't work if you're away from the building
  • They can't provide real-time information to emergency responders
  • They don't track patterns or predict risks

FireGuard solves ALL of these problems by creating a smart, connected system.

================================================================================
                          WHAT IS FIREGUARD?
================================================================================

FireGuard is a complete fire safety system with three main parts:

1. HARDWARE (The Sensors)
   - ESP32-S3 microcontroller (small computer)
   - MQ-2 Gas Sensor (detects smoke and gas)
   - Flame IR Sensor (detects fire/heat)
   - DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
   - Buzzer for local alarm
   
   These sensors are placed in different rooms and constantly monitor the air.

2. CLOUD BACKEND (The Brain)
   - Supabase (database and real-time updates)
   - PostgreSQL (stores all data)
   - Real-time subscriptions (instant updates)
   - Edge Functions (automatic actions)
   
   This is where all the data is collected, analyzed, and decisions are made.

3. WEB APPLICATION (The Dashboard)
   - Next.js 14 + React 18 (modern web framework)
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard
   - Device management
   - Analytics and reports
   - User authentication
   - Settings and customization
   
   This is what users see - a beautiful interface to monitor everything.

================================================================================
                        HOW FIREGUARD WORKS
================================================================================

STEP-BY-STEP FLOW:

1. SENSOR DETECTS DANGER
   └─ Temperature rises above 25°C (warning) or 45°C (critical)
   └─ Gas levels rise above 100 PPM (warning) or 500 PPM (critical)
   └─ Flame is detected
   └─ Humidity drops below 70% (warning) or 85% (critical)

2. ESP32 SENDS DATA TO CLOUD
   └─ Device sends sensor readings to Supabase every few seconds
   └─ Includes: temperature, gas, humidity, flame status, device location
   └─ Timestamp is recorded

3. SYSTEM ANALYZES DATA
   └─ Supabase checks if readings exceed thresholds
   └─ Determines severity: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
   └─ Creates an ALERT record in database

4. MULTIPLE NOTIFICATIONS SENT
   └─ EMAIL: Professional HTML email with details
   └─ SMS: Text message to phone (planned)
   └─ WEB: Real-time notification on dashboard

6. USER TAKES ACTION
   └─ Views dashboard for full details
   └─ Sees all affected devices
   └─ Can acknowledge the alert
   └─ Can view historical data
   └─ Can adjust thresholds if needed

================================================================================
                        ALERT FLOW EXPLAINED
================================================================================

WHEN A FIRE IS DETECTED:

1. SENSOR DETECTS FLAME
   └─ Flame IR sensor reads high value
   └─ ESP32 immediately sends alert to Supabase

2. SUPABASE RECEIVES DATA
   └─ Creates new alert record
   └─ Triggers webhook to Zapier
   └─ Stores in database

3. ZAPIER PROCESSES ALERT
   └─ Receives webhook from Supabase
   └─ Code step formats the data
   └─ Determines if it's "Alert" or "Warning"
   └─ Adds emoji and color coding

4. EMAIL IS SENT
   └─ Professional HTML email generated
   └─ Includes:
      • Alert type (🚨 Alert or ⚠️ Warning)
      • Severity level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
      • Message (what was detected)
      • Device ID and location
      • Exact timestamp (when it happened)
      • Temperature, gas, humidity readings (actual sensor values)
      • Threshold values that triggered the alert (as configured at alert time)
      • Action buttons (View Dashboard, Settings)
      • The GDevelopers branding
   └─ Sent to user's email address
   
   NOTE: Thresholds are captured at the moment the alert is created.
   If you change thresholds later, it won't affect past alerts.
   Future alerts will use the new threshold values.

5. USER RECEIVES EMAIL
   └─ Email arrives in inbox
   └─ User clicks "View Dashboard"
   └─ Sees real-time data on website

6. DASHBOARD SHOWS DETAILS
   └─ Map showing device location
   └─ Current sensor readings
   └─ Historical graphs
   └─ Recommended actions
   └─ Option to acknowledge alert

================================================================================
                        SEVERITY LEVELS
================================================================================

The system uses 4 severity levels:

1. LOW (ℹ️ - Blue)
   • Minor readings slightly above normal
   • Example: Temperature 22°C (slightly warm)
   • Action: Monitor the situation
   • Notification: Warning email

2. MEDIUM (⚡ - Yellow)
   • Readings in warning range
   • Example: Temperature 30°C (getting hot)
   • Action: Check the area
   • Notification: Warning email

3. HIGH (⚠️ - Orange)
   • Readings in danger range
   • Example: Temperature 42°C (very hot)
   • Action: Investigate immediately
   • Notification: Alert email

4. CRITICAL (🚨 - Red)
   • Readings in critical range
   • Example: Flame detected or Temperature 50°C
   • Action: EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY
   • Notification: Alert email + SMS + Local alarm

================================================================================
                        THRESHOLD MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: Thresholds can be changed anytime in Settings!

HOW THRESHOLDS WORK:
1. Each device has configurable warning and danger thresholds
2. When sensor data exceeds a threshold, an alert is created
3. The alert captures the CURRENT threshold values at that moment
4. Thresholds are stored in the DEVICE_SETTINGS table
5. Changing thresholds affects FUTURE alerts only, not past ones

CHANGING THRESHOLDS:
1. Go to Settings page
2. Click "Alert Thresholds" tab
3. Adjust warning and danger levels for:
   • Gas (PPM)
   • Temperature (°C)
   • Humidity (%)
4. Click "Save Thresholds"
5. New thresholds apply immediately to future alerts

ALERT HISTORY:
• Past alerts show the thresholds that were active when they were created
• You can view what threshold triggered each alert
• This helps track when you changed settings
• Useful for auditing and compliance

EXAMPLE:
• Original threshold: Gas danger = 500 PPM
• Alert created: "Gas level 520 PPM" (shows 500 PPM threshold)
• You change threshold to: 400 PPM
• Next alert: "Gas level 420 PPM" (shows 400 PPM threshold)
• Past alert still shows: 500 PPM threshold (what was active then)

================================================================================
                        CURRENT THRESHOLDS
================================================================================

These are the default settings (can be customized anytime in Settings):

TEMPERATURE:
  • Normal: Below 25°C
  • Warning: 25°C to 45°C
  • Critical: Above 45°C

GAS (PPM - Parts Per Million):
  • Normal: Below 100 PPM
  • Warning: 100 to 500 PPM
  • Critical: Above 500 PPM

HUMIDITY:
  • Normal: 70% to 85%
  • Warning: Below 70% or above 85%
  • Critical: Below 50% or above 95%

FLAME:
  • Normal: Not detected
  • Critical: Detected

ALERT COOLDOWN:
  • 10 minutes (600 seconds)
  • Prevents duplicate alerts for same issue
  • Resets when condition clears

================================================================================
                        EMAIL TEMPLATE
================================================================================

When an alert is sent, the email looks like this:
